# Image Processing with Python: Face Detection Project
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/afk9jnKFLBM?si=h8dAx6kOG8vankxj
#### Description:
This project demonstrates the use of Python libraries for basic image processing, specifically for face detection. The application uses **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe** to detect faces in an image and detect faces and retectangle them.

1. **Image Search**: Verifies whether an image file exists and is a valid image format.
2. **Face Detection**: Detects faces in an image and outputs a new image with face bounding boxes.
3. **Image Type Check**: Checks if a given file is an image based on its extension.
4. **Custom Image Manipulation**: Additional utility functions for image processing (e.g., resizing or converting formats).

The project demonstrates the usage of libraries like OpenCV and Mediapipe for image manipulation and processing.

### Features:
1. **Functionality**:
   - `function_1`: Validates the existence of an image and checks its type.
   - `function_2`: Detects faces in an image and saves the output with detected faces highlighted.
   - `function_3`: Resizes an image to predefined dimensions.
   - `function_4`: Converts an image to grayscale.

2. **Unit Tests**:
   - Thorough tests are included in the `test_project.py` file to ensure correctness of the implemented functions.
   - Tests validate image search, face detection, and image type verification.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Functions are modular and reusable, making it easy to extend functionality.
